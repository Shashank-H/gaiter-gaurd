# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Bun.js for backend runtime — TypeScript native, fast runtime, user preference
- Secret vault as v1 foundation — Credential isolation is the core trust boundary
- Dashboard-only approvals for v1 — Reduces scope, push notifications deferred to v2
- Polling-based async resolution — Simpler than WebSockets for v1
