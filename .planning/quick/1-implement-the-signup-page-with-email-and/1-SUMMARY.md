decisions:
  - Validate password match client-side before any API call to avoid unnecessary network round-trips
  - Match login.tsx visual style exactly (dark theme, same card layout, same input/button styles)
  - auto-complete="new-password" on both password fields to prevent browser autofill conflicts

# Quick Task 1: Signup Page Summary

**One-liner:** Signup page at /signup with email+password+confirm fields wired to backend /auth/register, with reciprocal login/signup navigation links.

## What Was Built

- `frontend/src/routes/signup.tsx` — New TanStack Router file-based route at `/signup`. Matches login page's dark theme, card layout, input/button styles. Three fields: email, password, confirm password. Client-side validation prevents API call if passwords mismatch. On success navigates to `/login`. Shows specific "An account with this email already exists" error for 409/duplicate responses, and generic fallback for other errors.

- `frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts` — Added `register()` method to the `api` object, symmetrical to the existing `login()` method. POSTs to `/auth/register` with email and password, returns parsed JSON response.

- `frontend/src/routes/login.tsx` — Added `Link` to the import from `@tanstack/react-router`. Added "Don't have an account? Sign up" link below the submit button pointing to `/signup`.

- `frontend/src/routeTree.gen.ts` — Auto-regenerated by TanStack Start Vite plugin during build to include the new `/signup` route.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add api.register() and create signup.tsx | 8103897 | endpoints.ts, signup.tsx, login.tsx, routeTree.gen.ts |

## Verification

- `bun run build` from frontend/ completed with no TypeScript errors (233 modules transformed)
- `frontend/src/routes/signup.tsx` exists and contains `createFileRoute('/signup')`
- `frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts` contains `register:`
- `login.tsx` imports `Link` and has link to `/signup`
- `signup.tsx` has link back to `/login`

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- frontend/src/routes/signup.tsx: FOUND
- frontend/src/api/endpoints.ts contains `register:`: FOUND
- login.tsx contains `/signup` link: FOUND
- Commit 8103897: FOUND
