# Phase 6.1: Agent Management UI - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Dashboard pages for creating, viewing, editing, and revoking AI agents with their service scopes and API keys. Users manage the full agent lifecycle through the web UI. This builds on the existing dashboard scaffolding from Phase 6.

## Implementation Decisions

### Agent list display
- Card-based layout, one card per agent (consistent with approval queue card pattern)
- Minimal card content: agent name, status indicator, key prefix (e.g., `agt_abc123...`)
- Active agents and revoked agents displayed in separate sections
- Revoked agents section collapsed by default
- CTA card for empty state: centered card with icon + "Create your first agent" button

### Claude's Discretion
- Creation flow and form layout (how the create form is presented, multi-step vs single form)
- One-time API key reveal UX (modal, inline, copy-to-clipboard behavior)
- Service scope selection UI (checkboxes, tags, or other pattern for assigning services)
- Revoke/delete confirmation patterns (dialog style, undo options)
- Card spacing, typography, and hover/click interactions
- Edit agent flow (inline editing vs separate page/modal)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Cards should match the visual style established in Phase 6's approval queue cards
- Key prefix display uses the `agt_` prefix format already established in Phase 3 backend

## Deferred Ideas
